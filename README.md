These are my solved CodeWars Tasks.
CodeWars is a platform that offers Coding Challenges.

Task Text from CodeWars.
DNA: "In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all"

Morse: "In this kata you have to write a simple Morse code decoder."..."Extra spaces before or after the code have no meaning and should be ignored." One Space means new character, Three spaces means new word.

OddPyramid: "Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

             1
          3     5
       7     9    11
   13    15    17    19
21    23    25    27    29
...

Calculate the row sums of this triangle from the row index (starting at index 1) e.g.:"

SameSumArray: "You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N."

Square: "Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number"

ValidBraces: "Write a function that takes a string of braces, and determines if the order of the braces is valid."
SpinningStrings: "Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed"
